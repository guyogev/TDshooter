#TDshooter

This is my pet project.
The main goal is to get hands-on experience.			
The idea is a 'Diablo' looking game, using open source resources.		

##about:
------
I make use of the LibGDX game development framework.
Under the main folder you see 4 projects (my-gdx-game prefix).
the *core* project contain most of the code. other projects are linked to it.
for more information about this setup visit [ligGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/). 

The game is designed with the MVC pattern, Therefore the code is divided into 3 sections:
###Model: 		
Holds the game data (sprite classes and source files). 
the Modal just holds the data, it can not change it or access the other sections. 		

###View:	
Display the Model to screen. the View cannot change inform Control if changes are needed.	

###Control:	
The game logic. access other sections and update the game objects state.
