TDshooter
=========

This is my pet project. The main goal is to get hands-on experience.			
The idea is a 'Diablo' looking game, using open source resources.		

about:
------
The game is designed with the MVC pattern, Therefore the code is divided into 3 sections:		

Model: 		
Holds the game data (sprite classes and source files). 
the Modal just holds the data, it can not change it or access the other sections. 		

View:	
Display the Model to screen. the View cannot change inform Control if changes are needed.	

Control:	
The game logic. access other sections and update the game objects state.



I make use of the LibGDX game development framework.
